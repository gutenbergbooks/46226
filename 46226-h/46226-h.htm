<p><b>NOTICE.</b>&mdash;The attention of those who take part in or
organise dramatic representations should be called to the law
on copyright. All representations of copyright dramatic
works are liable to fees, if either money or consideration
be taken for admission, tickets sold, a collection made, or
where any theatre, hall, or other place be hired for such
purpose. It is absolutely necessary that the fees for plays
should be paid in advance and an authorised permission
obtained, otherwise each person taking part, or causing
such play to be represented, is severally liable to a penalty
or damages, under 3rd and 4th William IV., c. 15, sec. 2.
By means of the telegraph, injunctions can be obtained to
restrain performances, which, if ignored, would lead to the
imprisonment of the offenders. Agents are appointed in
all parts of the kingdom, and are authorised to collect fees
on behalf of the various authors or proprietors, and are
empowered to exact full penalties where fees have not
been paid in advance. It is not necessary to have a
printed notice on a play to the effect that it is copyright,
although this is done in many instances. To save useless
correspondence it must be strictly understood that no
reduction can be made on account of a performance taking
place for the benefit of a charity, or any other cause whatever.
Any information on this subject can be obtained
by sending a stamped directed envelope to SAMUEL
FRENCH, Ltd., 26, Southampton Street, Strand, London.
<i>Fees on the plays which S. French, Ltd., collects for must
be paid by P.O.O. or cheque to the above address, or the

At least, the one I read wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> There&rsquo;s not so much harm in these French

unpacked, just to make sure it hadn&rsquo;t suffered in shipment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> (<i>enthusiastically&mdash;taking off gloves</i>) Ah!
you thought of the centuries that beautiful form had

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> Not a bit! I thought of the loss to our Company

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> (<span class="small">C.</span>) Ah, when you do! Where among your

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i><span class="small">L.</span> of table</i>) And which of the whole lot

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> Ah, Dunn! You are not familiar with the

<p><span class="smcap">Sill.</span> Don&rsquo;t despond Tompkins, it may <i>revive</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> Sculpture&rsquo;s right enough in its way&mdash;but it

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> And I sigh for the Antique&mdash;(<i>sits <span class="small">R.</span> of table

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> Not for me. I can&rsquo;t fancy existence without

I countenance every improvement. Move with

<p><span class="smcap">Sill.</span> (<span class="small">R.</span>) Well for modern tastes, there isn&rsquo;t always
too much clothing on our remnants of that early
period.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>crosses to <span class="smcap">Sillocks</span></i>) You&rsquo;re right. That&rsquo;s
one reason the women objected to the Niobe; and <i>it&rsquo;s</i>
decent enough for <i>anything</i>. The dress is apparently
split up a bit on one side, and shows part of the knee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> (<i>enthusiastically</i>) A classic knee, Sir,
which nothing in nature&mdash;Modern nature&mdash;could equal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<span class="small">C.</span> ) I did manage to have my own way for
once, and there it is, behind that four-fold screen, which
boxes it in completely. It&rsquo;s nicely out of the way there
too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> (<i>rising</i>) You&rsquo;d like to see it, Sillocks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sill.</span> Yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sill.</span> (<i>curiously</i>) What&rsquo;s she supposed to be doing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> (<i>back of table</i>) Weeping! You know the

tears: turned her into stone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> She&rsquo;d make an elegant ornament for a family

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> Sillocks! I would not take ten thousand

dug up in the ruins of Thebes in 1785; it passed into
the hands of a Florentine gentleman; but in 1825 Count
Bernoldi purchased it and it remained in his collection,

wrong it is to jump to these conclusions; you may misjudge
this woman and her purpose and object entirely,
and, right or wrong, Corney, <i>I&rsquo;m</i> blameless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<i>aside</i>) Ah! Peter knows she&rsquo;s unpopular
with the women and that the blame of engaging her will
fall upon him. (<i>fetching chair from table</i>) That&rsquo;s all
very well with me, Peter! (<i>puts chair near couch and
sits astride it, facing audience.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>aside</i>) With <i>him</i>! That means, at the worst
I can buy him off!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> But Helen and Carrie are prejudiced, and naturally
perhaps. You can&rsquo;t deny there is something <i>uncanny</i>
about the woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> There <i>is</i> perhaps&mdash;a <i>stony</i> look about the
eyes; but that will wear off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> It&rsquo;s hard to believe that she is of the same
<i>clay</i> as ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> Clay! She was never clay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> She might have been <i>cast in a different mould</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> She&rsquo;s not a casting at all&mdash;so&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> Of course there&rsquo;s no denying she&rsquo;s beautiful.
But I&rsquo;ve a prejudice against <i>these classic expressionless
women; these cold blocks of marble</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>as if paralyzed</i>) Marble&mdash;you do know
then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<i>looks at <span class="smcap">Dunn</span> quickly</i>) I know what <i>you</i>
ought to have known the moment you saw her, that
she was not the sort of thing, that&mdash;that&mdash;it wouldn&rsquo;t
do to have her about the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> I did know it, Corney, and I have tried. I
<i>have</i> tried to get her away, but I can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> Obdurate and unforgiving, eh? As I suspected;
she has a <i>heart of stone</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> Well, she <i>had</i>; of course that was changed
with the other alterations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<i>rises and puts chair back by table</i>) What?
She relents? She wavers in her purpose? Then let
her go. The matter&rsquo;s simple enough: pack her off!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>rises</i>) But I can&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s all so brutal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<i>with foot on stool</i>) Oh, she&rsquo;s told you the
whole story, eh? but remember my version will put an
entirely different light on it. And yet out of cold-blooded
vindictiveness she comes here to ruin me with Bea and
Sillocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>putting foot on stool; looks puzzled at <span class="smcap">Corney</span>&mdash;pause</i>)
Have you met her before? Have you got
that former existence theory?</p>

(<i><span class="smcap">Corney</span> turns going <span class="small">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> A year ago! (<i>stumbles over stool</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> Yes! When I <i>broke off</i> with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> Broke off! (<i>aside</i>) I didn&rsquo;t notice she had
anything missing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> Broke off my engagement with her sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>perplexed</i>) Whose sister?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> Mifton&rsquo;s sister, whom I met at Cambridge.
(<i>goes <span class="small">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>aside</i>) He&rsquo;s on the wrong tack; Heavens!
What a pitfall I nearly fell into! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> It&rsquo;s too bad Corney, to let you indulge in all
this unnecessary worry, but your fears are quite groundless.
The new Governess, Madeline Mifton, never heard
of you till last evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> I know better, Peter! She came here in her
sister&rsquo;s interest, to hunt me down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> Nothing of the kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> I tell you I learnt, on the best of authority,
that Madeline Mifton would certainly come here for the
purpose of going for me. (<i>crosses <span class="small">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>dropping into chair <span class="small">R. E.</span></i>) Great goodness!

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>enters from Library <span class="small">L. U. E.</span></i>) The Locksmith

there&rsquo;s no occasion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> Well, I&rsquo;m not so sure of that; and I&rsquo;ll satisfy
myself. There&rsquo;s some mystery connected with her.
And I&rsquo;ll find out <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> she came; and all about
her. (<i>crosses <span class="small">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> No! No! Don&rsquo;t you meddle or you&rsquo;ll ruin
everything! (<i>aside</i>) He must not see Niobe till I have
warned her. I&rsquo;ll run and see that locksmith and hurry
back. You remain quiet and I&rsquo;ll find out if you have
any cause for fear. Don&rsquo;t interfere, or you&rsquo;ll spoil
everything. Leave her to me. She&rsquo;s a peculiar woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>

She isn&rsquo;t such a fool; (<i>sits again, crosses legs</i>)
Excuse me. You find a great change, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mift.</span> (<i>looks after <span class="smcap">Carrie</span> and <span class="smcap">Helen</span>&mdash;then speaks

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<i><span class="small">L.</span>&mdash;aside</i>) The annoyance she&rsquo;s meeting with
will make her more spiteful to <i>me</i>. I must pacify her
the first thing. (<i>aloud</i>) We deeply regret the vile
treatment you have received. I myself am pained beyond
measure at the ignominy you have suffered.
(<i><span class="smcap">Dunn</span> enters <span class="small">R. U. E.</span>, as if from street, with paper parcel,

not for the ties of relationship, Mr. Dunn should answer
to me for his dastardly conduct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>coming down <span class="small">C.</span></i>) Should he? If you will
only show your authority for questioning, Mr. Dunn is
prepared with unlimited replies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> I have merely the authority of equity and common
justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> Justice for whom?</p>

<p class="directions"><i>During following scene <span class="smcap">Corney</span> bullies <span class="smcap">Dunn</span> very considerably.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<span class="small">L. C.</span>) Justice for all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<span class="small">C.</span>) That&rsquo;s rather a large order, isn&rsquo;t it?
and you might find your portion of it, a little more
than you bargained for; as for the little inconvenience
Miss Mifton has experienced&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mift.</span> (<span class="small">R. C.</span>) It is no small matter, Mr. Dunn, to
have your trunk seized and your dresses appropriated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> Even her very name has been stolen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> How do you know? I suppose there may be
other Miftons? (<i>to <span class="smcap">Mifton</span></i>) You don&rsquo;t quite claim a
monopoly for the name, do you Mifton?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mift.</span> It&rsquo;s a remarkable coincidence, that I should
find a person of <i>my name</i>, occupying my situation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> You were so long coming to <i>fill it</i>. You threw
away your chances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mift.</span> I merely delayed to call upon some friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<i>going to <span class="smcap">Dunn</span> <span class="small">C.</span></i>) The fact of Miss Mifton
being delayed is no excuse for the pretence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> But it accounts for the <i>mistake</i>. We had engaged
a Miss Mifton, and a Miss Mifton came; it was
a case of first come&mdash;first serve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mift.</span> But she appears here in my tea gown&mdash;she&rsquo;s
wearing my clothes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> That&rsquo;s your fault again for <i>sending them on</i>.
If you had <i>come in them</i>, it couldn&rsquo;t have happened.
And there&rsquo;s no desire to keep your clothes. The lady
will get some made with all possible dispatch. I have
here samples of materials that I have obtained for her
to select from. (<i>showing parcel</i>)</p>

<p class="directions"><i>N. B.&mdash;This parcel contains a number of small sample

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> You take a remarkable interest in this woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> The interest one naturally feels for the unprotected.
She is an Orphan; of <i>long standing</i>; she
is misjudged and suffering an injustice.</p>

<p class="directions"><i><span class="smcap">Corney</span> goes up to window <span class="small">L.</span></i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mift.</span> (<span class="small">R. C.</span>) You are strangely blind to <i>my</i> grievances,
Mr. Dunn. You engaged me as Governess, and I
came here to teach your children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<span class="small">C.</span>) No! No! Let us be correct. You came
here to hunt down the gay deceiver&mdash;(<i>indicating <span class="smcap">Corney</span>,
who comes quickly down to him <span class="small">C.</span></i>) who trifled
with the young affections of a confiding Mifton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<i>aside to <span class="smcap">Dunn</span></i>) Don&rsquo;t be a fool Peter; she&rsquo;ll
put up the damages, a couple of thousand, on a remark
like that. (<i>aloud</i>) What reason have you to suppose&mdash;who
could have told you such was the object of the
lady&rsquo;s visit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<span class="small">C.</span>) You told me yourself, and asked me to
speak to Miss Mifton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<span class="small">L. C.</span>) Not <i>that one</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> But you <i>meant</i> that one. Why, the other
hasn&rsquo;t had a sister for <i>years and years</i>. And it&rsquo;s the
sister you had broken off with. (<i>goes up and unties
parcel at cabinet <span class="small">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<span class="small">R.</span>) I never said she was broken off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mift.</span> (<i>comes down <span class="small">R. C.</span></i>) I admit I took the engagement
for the purpose, if it proved the same, of
speaking with Mr. Griffin of my sister; and if he still
loved her, to prepare him for the worst.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<i>with mock grief</i>) What! Is she dead? My
bonny Ethel, a thing of the past! Oh!</p>

<p class="directions"><i>Falls into chair <span class="small">R.</span> of table.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mift.</span> (<i>crosses to <span class="smcap">Corney</span></i>) No! No! Not that, Mr.
Griffin; my sister still lives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<i>rises</i>) Oh, I see; you mean the worst if I
refuse to compromise. Of course, it is to be regretted
that mercenary motives should creep in, where once
love reigned. And your case is not a strong one, Mr.
Dunn will tell you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>at table, arranging his patterns under newspaper</i>)
No, Mr. Dunn won&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t drag me into your
vile deceptions. I&rsquo;ve enough to worry with my own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> Why can&rsquo;t Ethel let by-gones be by-gones; she
must know I was an impressionable young jackass; that
we never could be happy together, at least I couldn&rsquo;t,
and she is very wrong, very wrong, to insist on marrying
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mift.</span> (<span class="small">C.</span>) She does not. How could she when she
is already married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<i>bus.</i>) Married! Oh, Miss Mifton&mdash;oh&mdash;(<i>aside</i>)
oh, this is lovely! (<i>going to <span class="small">L.</span> corner</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> Oh, what luck some people have!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mift.</span> (<span class="small">C.</span>) I came to plead to your generosity; her
husband believes she was never engaged before! She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
dreads you might disclose her deception, and expose her
letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> Ah! How she has misjudged me; I forgive
her freely; she shall have her letters&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mift.</span> Thank you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> In exchange for mine, of course. It must be
a sound reciprocal arrangement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mift.</span> Yes! Yes! I have them in my trunk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> Good! When you are packing, I will take
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>coming down</i>) And as you have now thoroughly
accomplished the object of your coming, Miss
Mifton, there is nothing further to detain you. I wish
you good day. (<i>taking her hand</i>) I&rsquo;m sorry you had
so much trouble, but compensation will of course&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mift.</span> (<i>withdrawing her hand, indignantly, and going
<span class="small">R.</span></i>) You are mistaken, Mr. Dunn. I could never
consent to leave the ladies in their distress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<i>crosses to <span class="smcap">Miss Mifton</span></i>) That sentiment
does you credit, Miss Mifton! Don&rsquo;t be intimidated, I
will stand by you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mift.</span> (<i>excitedly</i>) I will not! (<i>crosses <span class="small">C.</span>, <span class="smcap">Dunn</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<span class="small">L. C.</span>) Do you know you&rsquo;re spreading insubordination,
Cornelius Griffin, and breeding contempt for

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<i>returning <span class="small">C.</span></i>) I can&rsquo;t help that, Peter, I must

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<span class="small">C.</span>) Must you! How long has this wave of
virtuous indignation been raging along <i>your</i> seaboard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<span class="small">R. C.</span>) <i>For several minutes!</i> Aroused by the

to seize her trunk and pick the lock. (<i>goes <span class="small">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>following <span class="smcap">Corney</span> closely</i>) I did not. I only

that it fitted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<i>backing <span class="smcap">Dunn</span> to <span class="small">C.</span></i>) But you have the

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<i>turns on <span class="smcap">Dunn</span> across table</i>) I had a <i>high</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>same business</i>) I never had a high opinion
of <i>you</i> at any time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> I was mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> I wasn&rsquo;t! You&rsquo;re no good&mdash;you&rsquo;re not solid;
you&rsquo;ve about as much vertebral support to you as a rubber
pipe; you haven&rsquo;t the pluck to stand by your own
tom-fooleries, but shift the blame on to others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<i>across table</i>) You never will understand
how necessary it is for me not to worry. The doctor
says I <i>cannot</i> both worry and <i>live</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>across table</i>) Then worry and <i>die</i>! I&rsquo;ve
had enough of this scapegoat business. You can allot
me shares in a newer enterprise. (<i>sits <span class="small">R.</span> of table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<i>crossing behind table to <span class="small">C.</span></i>) And this is

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>turning fiercely</i>) Letting <i>me</i> down easy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<span class="small">C.</span>) Why certainly! Being, so to say, sullied
with my smaller vices has served to break your fall,
hasn&rsquo;t it? If you had possessed a spotless reputation,
the effect of your colossal villainy <i>now</i> would be paralyzing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>aghast</i>) <i>My colossal villainy!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> It&rsquo;s bad enough as it is. Carrie has washed

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> Preparing to depart! What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<span class="small">R. C.</span>) What for? You must see that I cannot
allow my sisters to remain longer under your roof.
(<i>turns from <span class="smcap">Dunn</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> Then take &rsquo;em away; you can take Helen
away, and Hattie too, I can even spare Hattie, but
Carrie ceased to be your sister when she became my

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<span class="small">C.</span>) There! I said you&rsquo;d be agreeable to
that. My argument was, that if <i>somebody</i> must go, it
would be better for you to get out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> Better&mdash;for me to get out!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> Yes! You have only one trunk to pack! The

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> Yes, it&rsquo;s seven to one against me; but I <i>decline</i>

as Niobe suggested. It might <i>not</i> have been believed; it
wouldn&rsquo;t have been, but I could have stuck to it instead
of floundering about, and getting up to my neck
in a quicksand of equivocation. (<i>rises, going <span class="small">C.</span></i>) If I

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<span class="small">R.</span>) Why not? It&rsquo;s only a question of having
enough men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> I have a score, and they will exercise every
care in getting it out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> Care&rsquo;s of no use, and a hundred men couldn&rsquo;t
get the Statue out! It isn&rsquo;t here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> Not here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Omnes.</span> Not here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> The figure has not been moved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> (<span class="small">R.</span>) It&rsquo;s here in the screen right enough, it
couldn&rsquo;t fly out of the window. (<i>opening screen</i>) Gone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Omnes.</span> Gone!!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> Nothing but the Pedestal!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>advancing <span class="small">R. C.</span></i>) Didn&rsquo;t I tell you so? Do
you think I am incapable of <i>ever</i> speaking the truth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> But where is it? Where! What is your explanation?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> I haven&rsquo;t got one! (<i>falling into chair <span class="small">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span> Absurd! Make a break at something. (<i>crossing
up stage and down and sits on table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> (<span class="small">C.</span>) Stupendous misfortune! You can have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
no conception of the awfulness of your avowal&mdash;you cannot
realize my loss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> I can realize the loss it is to our Company!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> What is filthy lucre? No money on earth can
compensate me for its destruction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<span class="small">L. C.</span>) Be calm, Mr. Tompkins!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> (<i><span class="small">R.</span> of table <span class="small">L. C.</span></i>) It will be found no doubt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> Calm! With such a treasure gone! Ah! You
know nothing of the halo of romance that surrounds
that figure. It was no ordinary piece of statuary.
There is a legend that no mortal hand carved or chiselled
it. It is believed to be the actual petrifaction of
the <i>identical once living Niobe</i>, wife of Amphion, King
of Thebes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>jumping up</i>) What! Niobe herself! And
you believe the story? You do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> Why should I doubt the possibility of human
petrifaction?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>rushing at <span class="smcap">Tompkins</span>, taking his hand</i>)
Bless you, Tompkins! Bless you! Now <i>I</i> can be believed!
(<i>crosses to others <span class="small">L. C.</span></i>) The truth seemed so
preposterous before, I dared not tell it. But now&mdash;oh&mdash;Tompkins!
Tompkins! (<i>embracing <span class="smcap">Tompkins</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomp.</span> (<i>pushing him away</i>) Why this excitement?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>going back <span class="small">R.</span></i>) Because she, Niobe herself,
from the time immediately after the Trojan war, who
was there in the stone, has come to life!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Omnes.</span> Come to life!!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunn.</span> (<i>on pedestal</i>) The uncovered electric wires
imparted some vital current to the system, which roused
the dormant principle of respiration and circulation, unpetrified
her limbs and she is alive; alive, oh! (<i>goes <span class="small">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nio.</span> (<i>seeing <span class="smcap">Tompkins</span></i>) What man is this?</p>
